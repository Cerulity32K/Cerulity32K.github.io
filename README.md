# My Website
This is my more professional website that contains my portfolio and blog.

As this was my first major webdev project, I'm not very happy with how the site is laid out. I know a bit more about web development, and I might reiterate the website with better UX, accessibility and flexibility, all things that this website sort of flops at achieving.
